# Features and Capabilities

- **Customizable Web Service:** The `hydra-bot` library allows you to tailor the service's behavior to fit your application requirements.
- **Easy Integration:** Simplified initialization with robust webhook support for client applications.
- **Scalable Administration:** Terminal commands provide a straightforward way to manage the service.

# Getting Started: Web Service

The web service will run locally on `localhost` using port `8080`. Below is an example of how to initialize the service:

```javascript
const hydraBot = require('hydra-bot');

(async () => {
    // Initialize and start the Web Service
    const WS = await hydraBot.initWs();
})();
```

### Commands for administration via terminal
The Web Service includes commands for administration and control directly through the terminal. These commands allow administrators to manage and monitor the service effectively.

### Using the Client Webhook
The service also supports webhook integration for client-side interaction. This feature allows external systems to send and receive real-time data, enabling seamless automation and communication.
